The performed numerical simulations indicate that the design of the control system is satisfactory and robust. Detumbling is achieved in both the proposed strategies (though with different degrees of satisfaction) and the pointing error in the tracking phase is kept below the required limit with a sufficiently large margin. A safe margin is very useful as it provides the control system robustness against unmodeled uncertainties. In order to achieve more realistic results, the model of the system shall be improved enhancing some features (for instance, implementing a more complete model for the magnetic field) and including dynamics discarded thus far (as the perturbations for the orbital dynamics).

Future developments to improve the proposed design shall tackle two issues. First, the implementation of a de-saturation mechanism, which is absolutely required in order to extend the mission lifetime. This could be implemented through the already present magnetorquer and a tailored control law. Second, the attitude determination and subsequent estimations shall be improved. This could be done by choosing sensors with faster update rates and by exploiting a different observer.
