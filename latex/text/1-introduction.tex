The aim of the project is to develop an attitude determination and control system for a 6U CubeSat in the LEO environment using COTS products. The following report presents the modeling of the dynamics of the spacecraft, the design of the ADCS system and finally the results of numerical simulations.

The spacecraft is modeled taking inspiration from \textit{RainCube} (\textbf{Ra}dar \textbf{in} a \textbf{Cube}Sat \cite{raincube}), which was an Earth observation satellite carrying a Nadir pointing antenna for radar measurements. The spacecraft was launched in 2018 and eventually decayed in December 2020. The considered mission profile will be divided in three phases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item an \textbf{uncontrolled} phase, right after orbit insertion
    \item a \textbf{de-tumbling} phase
    \item a \textbf{tracking} phase, in which the spacecraft is constantly re-oriented for mission purposes
\end{enumerate}
